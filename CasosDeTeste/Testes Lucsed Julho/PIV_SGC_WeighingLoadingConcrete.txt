	System returns "Input mode screen" to the Operator.
	Operator selects "SearchConcreteMix" on MainForm.
	Operator enters attributes (int Id, string Desciption, Composition Composition) of ConcreteMix.
	System retrieves attributes of ConcreteMix.
	If ["Existing ConcreteMix"]
		System displays the attributes of ConcreteMix on MainForm.
	Else
		System returns the message to the Operator.
	EndIf
	If ["there concrete weighing and loading to CivilWorks"]
		Operator enters attributes(int Id, string Description) of WeighingLoadingConcrete on MainForm.
